                    I'm a front-end developer working remotely from Colima,
                    MÃ©xico with more than 5 years of experience and Strong
                    knowledge of JavaScript and tools like Ember.js, Gulp,
                    Bower, Karma, Mocha and more. I enjoy building performance
                    optimized, well coded and modern applications. This can be
                    a small one pager but also a large-scale web application,
                    either alone or as an efficient and effective member of
                    a larger team with experience in Agile development
                    methodologies and pair programming. I'm also able to convert
                    your awesome design into hand coded, pixel perfect and cross
                    browser compatible HTML/CSS markup. And I'm eager to learn
                    new technologies to deliver awesome solutions.
